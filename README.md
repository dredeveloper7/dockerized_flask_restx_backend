- Using docker-compose up command you will be able to access flask backend via Local Host URL and therefore server defined URL (localhost:80) and the 80 doesnt need to be specified
# Swagger doc on localhost/doc
# lastly when developing with a front end:
- Dont spin up the container just spin up the development server 
- Enter the backend folder and run the usual "flask run"
